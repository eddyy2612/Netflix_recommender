# Netflix_recommender

## Overview
This project is a Netflix Recommender System that suggests movies and TV shows to users based on their preferences. The model is trained using Python and various machine learning libraries to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends shows based on genre, actors, and plot similarity.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests content based on user behavior and ratings.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both approaches for improved recommendations.
- **User-Based & Item-Based Recommendations**: Provides personalized results based on viewing history.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `surprise` for collaborative filtering algorithms
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization

## Data Source
- Netflix dataset from kaggle.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a web app for real-time recommendations.
- Incorporation of deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Support for real-time user interactions and feedback.
